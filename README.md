# Netatmo component

This repo is a custom component from the beta version of the official HA Netatmo component.

Add this repo as a custom repo in HACS and install it. Remove the old Netatmo integration. Reboot Home Assistant and configure the newly installed netatmo component through the integration page as per the old one.
